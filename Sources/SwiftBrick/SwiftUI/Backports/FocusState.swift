    /// and ``View/ss.focused(_:)`` to
    /// describe views whose appearance and contents relate to the location of
    /// focus in the scene. When focus enters the modified view, the wrapped value
    /// of this property updates to match a given prototype value. Similarly, when
    /// focus leaves, the wrapped value of this property resets to `nil`
    /// or `false`. Setting the property's value programmatically has the reverse
    /// effect, causing focus to move to the view associated with the
    /// updated value.
